# Iteration-3
Title: Whatâ€™s Menu for the day


Prompt the user with a menu with the following items:

Perfect Number or Not

X Raised to Y

Factorial

Fibonacci

Exit


For item 1, ask the user to enter a positive number and determine if it is a perfect number or not. Refer to your notes.


For item 2, ask the user to enter two integers, x and y.  Compute and display for the power when x is raised to y.  Note that for this problem, x and y are integers.


For item 3, ask the user to enter a non-negative number, say n.  Compute and display for the factorial of n. Sample: The factorial of 5 (written as 5!) is 5*4*3*2*1 which is 120.


For item 4, ask the user to enter a positive number, say n.  Display the nth element in the Fibonacci sequence.


For item 5, terminates the program.


Notice that at the very least, the menu has to be displayed at least once.
